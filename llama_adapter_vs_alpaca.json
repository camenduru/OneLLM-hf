This number is based on the number of lightning strikes detected by lightning detection systems, which are located in various parts of the world. Lightning strikes occur when there is a build-up of electricity in the atmosphere, which is caused by the difference in temperature between the ground and the clouds. When the temperature difference reaches a certain threshold, the electricity is discharged in the form of lightning. The number of lightning strikes each day is dependent on the weather conditions, such as the amount of moisture in the air and the amount of cloud cover.", "response2": "Approximately 100 lightning strikes occur on Earth each day. This is because lightning is a natural phenomenon that is caused by the discharge of atmospheric electricity.
